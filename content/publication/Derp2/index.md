abstract: "The estimation of magma storage conditions is crucial for the understanding of magma plumbing systems (e.g. Putirka, 2017). In addition to geophysical approaches, petrologic and geochemical investigations of volcanic rocks are the only methods available to constrain temperature, pressure, volatile and oxygen fugacities prevailing in magma chambers, as well as the time-scales over which magmatic processes operate. Applying experimentally calibrated thermobarometeric models to analyses of coexisting phases (e.g. Blundy & Cashman, 2008) or the trace element content of solid phases (e.g. Thomas et al., 2010) is the most common approach used in petrology to estimate pressures and temperatures of magma storage. The quality of the extracted pressures and..."

summary: "Gualda et al. (2018) applied rhyolite-MELTS and DERP to several case studies and noted that DERP has a lower precision and yields distributions of estimated pressures that are significantly different from other geobarometers based on the H2O–CO2 of glass inclusions and amphibole geobarometry. In an attempt to clarify the discrepancy between rhyolite-MELT and DERP, Gualda et al. (2018) describe several problems with DERP. In the following sections we address the critical points mentioned in the comment of Gualda et al. (2018)."
