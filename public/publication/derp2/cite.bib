    abstract = "{The estimation of magma storage conditions is crucial for the understanding of magma plumbing systems (e.g. Putirka, 2017). In addition to geophysical approaches, petrologic and geochemical investigations of volcanic rocks are the only methods available to constrain temperature, pressure, volatile and oxygen fugacities prevailing in magma chambers, as well as the time-scales over which magmatic processes operate. Applying experimentally calibrated thermobarometeric models to analyses of coexisting phases (e.g. Blundy \\&amp; Cashman, 2008) or the trace element content of solid phases (e.g. Thomas et al., 2010) is the most common approach used in petrology to estimate pressures and temperatures of magma storage. The quality of the extracted pressures and temperatures is subject to two main limitations: (1) the application of a thermobarometeric model is often limited to the restricted compositional range for which it was calibrated experimentally. This is especially the case for empirical models. (2) The phases that are used for thermobarometry have to be in chemical equilibrium, a condition which, as emphasized by Gualda et al. in their comment, is not always fulfilled, especially considering the conceptual framework of magma evolution in crystal mushes that has gained in popularity over the last decade (Bachmann \\&amp; Bergantz, 2008; Cooper, 2017).}",
